        abstract keyword on classes
            explain and show (on Animal)

        abstract keyword on methods
            explain and show (on Animal)
            makeNoise() is abstract
            walk() is non-abstract
            breathe is a final non-abstract method

        make an animal farm class

        try to instantiate an Animal

        make a pig subclass

        make a chicken subclass

        show array of abstract data types
            add a pig and a chicken
            iterate over the array
            have each make a noise

        *** introduce the interface
            NO instance variables (only constants)
            all methods by default are PUBLIC and ABSTRACT

        define interface for FlyingAnimal
            explain history of "...able" names

        add FlyingAnimal to chicken

        add a Duck class

        show array of FlyingAnimals

        show default interface method
           glide()

*       summary
        abstract classes when it doesn't make sense to instantiate a class of it (like Animal)
            single inheritance problem
            IS A

*       interfaces when you want to define an additional behavior for any class to use
            CAN ALSO DO THIS BEHAVIOR
            multiple interfaces
            default methods for shared code
